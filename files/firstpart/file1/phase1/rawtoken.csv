through
the
World
Bank
Harvard

Since
becoming
the
COO
of
Facebook
in
Sheryl
Sandberg
has
managed
the
social
media
giant
s
complex
business
operations
More
recently
she
has
taken
on
a
second
no
less
public
role
outside
the
company
as
an
outspoken
advocate
for
women
aspiring
to
leadership
positions
Her
new
book
Lean
In
mdash
which
Sandberg
describes
as
sort
of
a
feminist
manifesto
mdash
is
a
call
for
women
to
act
in
their
own
behalf
to
overcome
institutional
and
personal
barriers
to
success
In
this
edited
interview
with
HBR
s
editor
in
chief
Adi
Ignatius
Sandberg
explains
why
the
workplace
is
ready
for
a
revolution
HBR
What
do
you
mean
when
you
refer
to
your
book
as
sort
of
a
feminist
manifesto
Sandberg
The
book
is
a
combination
of
things
It
s
partly
stories
from
my
own
life
and
experience
partly
data
and
research
about
gender
issues
and
partly
a
call
to
action
by
and
for
women
Would
you
describe
yourself
as
a
feminist
That
word
has
taken
a
beating
in
recent
years
Had
you
asked
me
that
when
I
was
in
college
I
would
have
said
I
was
not
But
I
think
we
need
to
reclaim
the
F
word
if
it
means
supporting
equal
opportunities
for
men
and
women
What
s
the
big
idea
in
Lean
In
The
book
is
for
any
woman
who
wants
advice
on
how
to
sit
at
any
table
she
wants
to
sit
at
and
for
any
man
who
wants
to
be
part
of
creating
a
more
equal
world
If
we
could
get
to
a
place
of
true
equality
where
what
we
do
in
life
is
determined
not
by
gender
but
by
our
passions
and
interests
our
companies
would
be
more
productive
and
our
home
lives
not
just
better
balanced
but
happier
You
talk
in
the
book
about
reigniting
a
revolution
How
would
you
like
to
see
that
happen
Women
are
making
progress
at
every
level
except
as
leaders
We
started
accounting
for
of
college
degrees
years
ago
but
progress
at
the
top
has
stalled
For
the
past
decade
women
in
corporate
America
have
held
only
about
of
C
suite
jobs
and
of
board
seats
There
aren
t
enough
women
sitting
at
the
tables
where
decisions
are
made
Reigniting
the
revolution
means
I
want
us
to
notice
all
of
this
and
find
ways
to
encourage
more
women
to
step
up
and
more
companies
to
recognize
what
women
bring
to
the
table
What
s
the
cost
to
society
when
women
don
t
pursue
their
ambitions
fully
Warren
Buffett
has
said
quite
graciously
and
famously
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
his
success
is
that
he
had
to
compete
with
only
half
the
population
The
more
people
who
get
in
the
race
the
faster
the
running
times
will
be
Some
have
criticized
you
for
essentially
blaming
women
for
not
being
better
even
though
many
of
the
challenges
they
confront
are
institutional
How
do
you
respond
Women
face
huge
institutional
barriers
But
we
also
face
barriers
that
exist
within
ourselves
sometimes
as
the
result
of
our
socialization
For
most
of
my
professional
life
no
one
ever
talked
to
me
about
the
ways
I
held
myself
back
I
m
trying
to
add
to
that
side
of
the
debate
There
s
a
great
from
Alice
Walker
The
most
common
way
people
give
up
their
power
is
by
thinking
they
don
t
have
any
I
am
not
blaming
women
I
m
helping
them
see
the
power
they
ve
got
and
encouraging
them
to
use
it
Say
more
about
how
women
hold
themselves
back
One
important
way
as
I
write
in
the
book
is
that
they
leave
before
they
leave
That
is
they
take
themselves
out
of
the
running
for
career
advancement
because
they
want
to
have
a
family
But
in
some
cases
they
re
making
these
decisions
years
in
advance
mdash
before
they
even
have
a
partner
That
should
be
a
time
when
they
lean
in
not
pull
back
We
re
talking
a
lot
about
what
women
do
wrong
What
do
female
leaders
do
well
that
men
should
emulate
I
don
t
believe
there
are
stereotypical
forms
of
male
and
female
leadership
But
I
think
there
are
things
we
re
encouraged
to
do
as
women
that
can
be
good
for
all
leaders
Women
are
often
very
good
listeners
They
are
often
good
consensus
builders
They
can
make
teams
cohesive
Illustration
Walter
Newton
Is
the
ultimate
goal
for
men
and
women
to
become
more
like
each
other
or
to
identify
and
celebrate
the
differences
