Lithuanian
authorities
are
using
Google
Maps
Street
View
to
comb
through
the
country
s
larger
cities
for
signs
of
residents
not
paying
their
taxes
The
Associated
Press
reports
that
tax
inspectors
are
searching
Street
View
imagery
for
undocumented
property
and
construction
that
might
signal
a
tax
violation
Over
just
a
few
months
the
agency
found
a
number
of
buildings
that
hadn
t
been
registered
and
managed
to
identify
homeowners
and
construction
companies
as
possible
tax
dodgers
mdash
at
least
one
of
which
owes
around
The
country
s
state
tax
inspectorate
began
using
Street
View
after
Google
s
service
launched
in
the
country
earlier
this
year
reports
the
AP
Once
a
suspicious
site
was
found
an
inspector
went
out
to
physically
review
the
location
Because
the
agency
could
selectively
choose
when
to
send
out
inspectors
rather
than
having
to
rely
on
in
person
monitoring
to
detect
these
violations
it
was
able
to
more
efficiently
track
down
tax
dodgers
Due
to
its
initial
success
the
authority
plans
to
look
through
the
past
two
years
worth
of
properties
purchased
by
suspicious
companies
The
tax
inspectorate
believes
that
this
type
of
surveillance
doesn
t
violate
Lithuanian
citizens
civil
rights
We
conducted
precise
legal
consultations
There
are
no
rights
violations
an
agency
spokesperson
told
the
AP
A
lawyer
at
the
Human
Rights
Monitoring
Institute
in
the
Lithuanian
capitol
agrees
but
he
suggests
that
if
the
authorities
had
not
also
taken
physical
inspections
that
there
may
have
been
cause
for
concern
He
told
the
AP
If
they
were
using
it
as
the
sole
tool
then
it
could
possibly
be
qualified
as
a
violation
But
in
this
case
it
s
just
using
a
modern
resource
